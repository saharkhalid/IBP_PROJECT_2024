# IBP(Internet Based Programming) Course Project
My project, which I created using PHP Laravel for the internet based programming course (CPE212).

- PHP 8.1
- Laravel 10.10.1
- Database: MySQL
- [Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/) is used for Authentication/Authorization.
- I used the [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io) Template to build the frontend.
